# 1.Introduction
## 1.1 Business question
The company SuperStore is a global retail company, hence it has a large customer base. On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department intends to launch marketing campaigns to express gratitude to customers who have supported the company throughout the time. Additionally, the goal is to explore potential customers who may become loyal patrons.

However, the Marketing department has not yet segmented the customers for this year because the dataset is too large to be manually processed as in previous years. Therefore, they have enlisted the help of the Data Analysis department to assist in implementing a classification algorithm to categorize each customer segment. This will enable the deployment of tailored marketing programs for each customer group.

Suggestion to the Marketing and Sales teams within the retail model of Superstore would be to focus most on which of the three indices R, F, M?

## 1.2 Dataset
