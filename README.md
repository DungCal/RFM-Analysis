# I.Introduction
## 1.Business question
- The company SuperStore is a global retail company, hence it has a large customer base. On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department intends to launch marketing campaigns to express gratitude to customers who have supported the company throughout the time. Additionally, the goal is to explore potential customers who may become loyal patrons.

- However, the Marketing department has not yet segmented the customers for this year because the dataset is too large to be manually processed as in previous years. Therefore, they have enlisted the help of the Data Analysis department to assist in implementing a classification algorithm to categorize each customer segment. This will enable the deployment of tailored marketing programs for each customer group.

- Suggestion to the Marketing and Sales teams within the retail model of Superstore would be to focus most on which of the three indices R, F, M?

## 2.Dataset
- RFM Dataset includes 2 tables: e commerce retail and segmentation. E commerce retail table transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## 3.Method
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, and it is a method used in marketing and customer relationship management to analyze and categorize customers based on their transaction behavior.

- **Recency (R)**: This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase or engaged with the business. Customers who have made a transaction more recently are often considered more valuable.

- **Frequency (F)**: This measures how often a customer makes a purchase or engages with the business within a specific timeframe. Customers with higher frequency are generally more loyal.

- **Monetary Value (M)**: This measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. Customers with a higher monetary value are considered high-value customers.

By analyzing and combining these three factors, businesses can create customer segments to target specific groups with tailored marketing campaigns.
